## About
Android app created by myself in collaboration with Mateusz Kozak ( https://github.com/MatiMatik97 ) as a Bachelor's Thesis in Computer Engineering.

The full thesis can be found at my Linkedin page linked below (mind it was written in Polish with exclusion of abstract that is available in english). The linked document contains the full documentation along with screenshots of the application and user manual.

## Abstract

  This paper presents the design and implementation of the weather analysis system for travelling. The discussed solution is intended to supplement the set of "maps" type
applications with additional functionality. Very often, during long journeys, the user encounters a storm or heavy rain on the way. In such conditions, you should move at 
a limited speed and with extreme caution, which causes a loss of time and exposes the user to stress, and in special situations to a threat to health and life. The program
presents the user with forecasted weather conditions at points located along the planned travel route in the expected time of the user's stay at a given point. Thanks to the
access to such data, it is possible to plan the trip in such a way that it takes place under the desired conditions, or to properly prepare for the trip if difficult conditions
cannot be avoided.

## Used Technology
 Core of the application was written in Java using Android Studio. Three application Programmin interfaces were used to make the application functional:
 * Climacell
 * Mapquest
 * Geonames
 
 For the database, Firebase was used.
